			<p class="verseline">Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour</p>
			<p class="verseline">Draws on apace; four happy days bring in</p>
			<p class="verseline">Another moon; but, O, methinks, how slow</p>
			<p class="verseline">This old moon wanes! She lingers my desires,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Like to a step-dame or a dowager,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Long withering out a young man’s revenue.</p>
			<p class="character">Hippolyta</p>

			<p class="character">Theseus</p>
			<p class="verseline">Go, Philostrate,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Turn melancholy forth to funerals;</p>
			<p class="verseline">The pale companion is not for our pomp.<span class="stage_directions_inline"> Exit Philostrate</span></p>
			<p class="verseline">Hippolyta, I woo’d thee with my sword,</p>

			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text">Enter Egeus, and his daughter Hermia, Lysander, and Demetrius</h2>
			<p class="character">Egeus</p>
			<p class="verseline">Happy be Theseus, our renowned Duke!</p>
			<p class="character">Theseus</p>
			<p class="verseline">Thanks, good Egeus; what’s the news with thee?</p>
			<p class="character">Egeus</p>
			<p class="verseline">Full of vexation come I, with complaint</p>
			<p class="verseline">Against my child, my daughter Hermia.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,</p>
			<p class="verseline">This man hath my consent to marry her.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Stand forth, Lysander. And, my gracious Duke,</p>
			<p class="verseline">This man hath bewitch’d the bosom of my child.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And interchang’d love-tokens with my child;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,</p>
			<p class="verseline">With feigning voice, verses of feigning love,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And stol’n the impression of her fantasy</p>
			<p class="verseline">With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats- messengers</p>
			<p class="verseline">Of strong prevailment in unhardened youth;</p>
			<p class="verseline">With cunning hast thou filch’d my daughter’s heart;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Turn’d her obedience, which is due to me,</p>
			<p class="verseline">To stubborn harshness. And, my gracious Duke,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Be it so she will not here before your Grace</p>
			<p class="verseline">Consent to marry with Demetrius,</p>
			<p class="verseline">I beg the ancient privilege of Athens:</p>
			<p class="verseline">As she is mine I may dispose of her;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Which shall be either to this gentleman</p>
			<p class="verseline">Or to her death, according to our law</p>
			<p class="verseline">Immediately provided in that case.</p>
			<p class="character">Theseus</p>
			<p class="verseline">What say you, Hermia? Be advis’d, fair maid.</p>
			<p class="verseline">To you your father should be as a god;</p>
			<p class="verseline">One that compos’d your beauties; yea, and one</p>
			<p class="verseline">To whom you are but as a form in wax,</p>
			<p class="verseline">By him imprinted, and within his power</p>
			<p class="verseline">To leave the figure, or disfigure it.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.</p>
			<p class="character">Hermia</p>
			<p class="verseline">So is Lysander.</p>
			<p class="character">Theseus</p>
			<p class="verseline">In himself he is;</p>
			<p class="verseline">But, in this kind, wanting your father’s voice,</p>
			<p class="verseline">The other must be held the worthier.</p>
			<p class="character">Hermia</p>
			<p class="verseline">I would my father look’d but with my eyes.</p>
			<p class="character">Theseus</p>
			<p class="verseline">Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.</p>
			<p class="character">Hermia</p>
			<p class="verseline">I do entreat your Grace to pardon me.</p>
			<p class="verseline">I know not by what power I am made bold,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Nor how it may concern my modesty</p>
			<p class="verseline">In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;</p>
			<p class="verseline">But I beseech your Grace that I may know</p>
			<p class="verseline">The worst that may befall me in this case,</p>
			<p class="verseline">If I refuse to wed Demetrius.</p>
			<p class="character">Theseus</p>
			<p class="verseline">Either to die the death, or to abjure</p>
			<p class="verseline">For ever the society of men.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Know of your youth, examine well your blood,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Whether, if you yield not to your father’s choice,</p>
			<p class="verseline">You can endure the livery of a nun,</p>
			<p class="verseline">For aye to be shady cloister mew’d,</p>
			<p class="verseline">To live a barren sister all your life,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood</p>
			<p class="verseline">To undergo such maiden pilgrimage;</p>
			<p class="verseline">But earthlier happy is the rose distill’d</p>
			<p class="verseline">Than that which withering on the virgin thorn</p>
			<p class="verseline">Grows, lives, and dies, in single blessedness.</p>
			<p class="character">Hermia</p>
			<p class="verseline">So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Ere I will yield my virgin patent up</p>
			<p class="verseline">Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke</p>
			<p class="verseline">My soul consents not to give sovereignty.</p>
			<p class="character">Theseus</p>
			<p class="verseline">Take time to pause; and by the next new moon—</p>
			<p class="verseline">The sealing-day betwixt my love and me</p>
			<p class="verseline">For everlasting bond of fellowship—</p>
			<p class="verseline">Upon that day either prepare to die</p>
			<p class="verseline">For disobedience to your father’s will,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Or on Diana’s altar to protest</p>
			<p class="verseline">For aye austerity and single life.</p>
			<p class="character">Demetrius</p>
			<p class="verseline">Relent, sweet Hermia; and, Lysander, yield</p>
			<p class="verseline">Thy crazed title to my certain right.</p>
			<p class="character">Lysander</p>
			<p class="verseline">You have her father’s love, Demetrius;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Let me have Hermia’s; do you marry him.</p>
			<p class="character">Egeus</p>
			<p class="verseline">Scornful Lysander, true, he hath my love;</p>
			<p class="verseline">And what is mine my love shall render him;</p>
			<p class="verseline">And she is mine; and all my right of her</p>
			<p class="verseline">I do estate unto Demetrius.</p>
			<p class="character">Lysander</p>
			<p class="verseline">I am, my lord, as well deriv’d as he,</p>
			<p class="verseline">As well possess’d; my love is more than his;</p>
			<p class="verseline">My fortunes every way as fairly rank’d,</p>
			<p class="verseline">If not with vantage, as Demetrius’;</p>
			<p class="verseline">And, which is more than all these boasts can be,</p>
			<p class="verseline">I am belov’d of beauteous Hermia.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Why should not I then prosecute my right?</p>
			<p class="verseline">Demetrius, I’ll avouch it to his head,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Made love to Nedar’s daughter, Helena,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Upon this spotted and inconstant man.</p>
			<p class="character">Theseus</p>
			<p class="verseline">I must confess that I have heard so much,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;</p>
			<p class="verseline">But, being over-full of self-affairs,</p>
			<p class="verseline">My mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come;</p>
			<p class="verseline">And come, Egeus; you shall go with me;</p>
			<p class="verseline">I have some private schooling for you both.</p>
			<p class="verseline">For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself</p>
			<p class="verseline">To fit your fancies to your father’s will,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Or else the law of Athens yields you up—</p>
			<p class="verseline">Which by no means we may extenuate—</p>
			<p class="verseline">To death, or to a vow of single life.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Come, my Hippolyta; what cheer, my love?</p>
			<p class="verseline">Demetrius, and Egeus, go along;</p>
			<p class="verseline">I must employ you in some business</p>
			<p class="verseline">Against our nuptial, and confer with you</p>
			<p class="verseline">Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.</p>
			<p class="character">Egeus</p>
			<p class="verseline">With duty and desire we follow you.</p>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text">Exeunt all but Lysander and Hermia</h2>
			<p class="character">Lysander</p>
			<p class="verseline">How now, my love! Why is your cheek so pale?</p>
			<p class="verseline">How chance the roses there do fade so fast?</p>
			<p class="character">Hermia</p>
			<p class="verseline">Belike for want of rain, which I could well</p>
			<p class="verseline">Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.</p>
			<p class="character">Lysander</p>
			<p class="verseline">Ay me! for aught that I could ever read,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Could ever hear by tale or history,</p>
			<p class="verseline">The course of true love never did run smooth;</p>
			<p class="verseline">But either it was different in blood—</p>
			<p class="character">Hermia</p>
			<p class="verseline">O cross! too high to be enthrall’d to low.</p>
			<p class="character">Lysander</p>
			<p class="verseline">Or else misgraffed in respect of years—</p>
			<p class="character">Hermia</p>
			<p class="verseline">O spite! too old to be engag’d to young.</p>
			<p class="character">Lysander</p>
			<p class="verseline">Or else it stood upon the choice of friends—</p>
			<p class="character">Hermia</p>
			<p class="verseline">O hell! to choose love by another’s eyes.</p>
			<p class="character">Lysander</p>
			<p class="verseline">Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,</p>
			<p class="verseline">War, death, or sickness, did lay siege to it,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Making it momentary as a sound,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Swift as a shadow, short as any dream,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Brief as the lightning in the collied night</p>
			<p class="verseline">That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And ere a man hath power to say ‘Behold!’</p>
			<p class="verseline">The jaws of darkness do devour it up;</p>
			<p class="verseline">So quick bright things come to confusion.</p>
			<p class="character">Hermia</p>
			<p class="verseline">If then true lovers have ever cross’d,</p>
			<p class="verseline">It stands as an edict in destiny.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Then let us teach our trial patience,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Because it is a customary cross,</p>
			<p class="verseline">As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Wishes and tears, poor Fancy’s followers.</p>
			<p class="character">Lysander</p>
			<p class="verseline">A good persuasion; therefore, hear me, Hermia.</p>
			<p class="verseline">I have a widow aunt, a dowager</p>
			<p class="verseline">Of great revenue, and she hath no child—</p>
			<p class="verseline">From Athens is her house remote seven leagues—</p>
			<p class="verseline">And she respects me as her only son.</p>
			<p class="verseline">There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;</p>
			<p class="verseline">And to that place the sharp Athenian law</p>
			<p class="verseline">Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Steal forth thy father’s house to-morrow night;</p>
			<p class="verseline">And in the wood, a league without the town,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Where I did meet thee once with Helena</p>
			<p class="verseline">To do observance to a morn of May,</p>
			<p class="verseline">There will I stay for thee.</p>
			<p class="character">Hermia</p>
			<p class="verseline">My good Lysander!</p>
			<p class="verseline">I swear to thee by Cupid’s strongest bow,</p>
			<p class="verseline">By his best arrow, with the golden head,</p>
			<p class="verseline">By the simplicity of Venus’ doves,</p>
			<p class="verseline">By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And by that fire which burn’d the Carthage Queen,</p>
			<p class="verseline">When the false Troyan under sail was seen,</p>
			<p class="verseline">By all the vows that ever men have broke,</p>
			<p class="verseline">In number more than ever women spoke,</p>
			<p class="verseline">In that same place thou hast appointed me,</p>
			<p class="verseline">To-morrow truly will I meet with thee.</p>
			<p class="character">Lysander</p>
			<p class="verseline">Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.</p>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text">Enter Helena</h2>

			<p class="verseline">God speed fair Helena! Whither away?</p>
			<p class="character">Helena</p>
			<p class="verseline">Call you me fair? That fair again unsay.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Demetrius loves your fair. O happy fair!</p>
			<p class="verseline">Your eyes are lode-stars and your tongue’s sweet air</p>
			<p class="verseline">More tuneable than lark to shepherd’s ear,</p>
			<p class="verseline">When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Sickness is catching; O, were favour so,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go!</p>
			<p class="verseline">My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,</p>
			<p class="verseline">My tongue should catch your tongue’s sweet melody.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,</p>
			<p class="verseline">The rest I’d give to be to you translated.</p>
			<p class="verseline">O, teach me how you look, and with what art</p>
			<p class="verseline">You sway the motion of Demetrius’ heart!</p>
			<p class="character">Hermia</p>
			<p class="verseline">I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.</p>
			<p class="character">Helena</p>
			<p class="verseline">O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!</p>
			<p class="character">Hermia</p>
			<p class="verseline">I give him curses, yet he gives me love.</p>
			<p class="character">Helena</p>
			<p class="verseline">O that my prayers could such affection move!</p>
			<p class="character">Hermia</p>
			<p class="verseline">The more I hate, the more he follows me.</p>
			<p class="character">Helena</p>
			<p class="verseline">The more I love, the more he hateth me.</p>
			<p class="character">Hermia</p>
			<p class="verseline">His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.</p>
			<p class="character">Helena</p>
			<p class="verseline">None, but your beauty; would that fault were mine!</p>
			<p class="character">Hermia</p>
			<p class="verseline">Take comfort: he no more shall see my face;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Lysander and myself will fly this place.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Before the time I did Lysander see,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Seem’d Athens as a paradise to me.</p>
			<p class="verseline">O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,</p>
			<p class="verseline">That he hath turn’d a heaven unto a hell!</p>
			<p class="character">Lysander</p>
			<p class="verseline">Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:</p>
			<p class="verseline">To-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold</p>
			<p class="verseline">Her silver visage in the wat’ry glass,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,</p>
			<p class="verseline">A time that lovers’ flights doth still conceal,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Through Athens’ gates have we devis’d to steal.</p>
			<p class="character">Hermia</p>
			<p class="verseline">And in the wood where often you and I</p>
			<p class="verseline">Upon faint primrose beds were wont to lie,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,</p>
			<p class="verseline">There my Lysander and myself shall meet;</p>
			<p class="verseline">And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,</p>

			<p class="verseline">Farewell, sweet playfellow; pray thou for us,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!</p>

			<p class="verseline">How happy some o’er other some can be!</p>
			<p class="verseline">Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.</p>
			<p class="verseline">But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;</p>
			<p class="verseline">He will not know what all but he do know.</p>
			<p class="verseline">And as he errs, doting on Hermia’s eyes,</p>
			<p class="verseline">So I, admiring of his qualities.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Things base and vile, holding no quantity,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Love can transpose to form and dignity.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;</p>
			<p class="verseline">And therefore is wing’d Cupid painted blind.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Nor hath Love’s mind of any judgment taste;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste;</p>
			<p class="verseline">And therefore is Love said to be a child,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Because in choice he is so oft beguil’d.</p>
			<p class="verseline">As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,</p>
			<p class="verseline">So the boy Love is perjur’d everywhere;</p>
			<p class="verseline">For ere Demetrius look’d on Hermia’s eyne,</p>
			<p class="verseline">He hail’d down oaths that he was only mine;</p>
			<p class="verseline">And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,</p>
			<p class="verseline">So he dissolv’d, and show’rs of oaths did melt.</p>

			<p class="character">Quince</p>
			<p class="verseline">Is all our company here?</p>
			<p class="character">Bottom</p>
			<p class="prose">You were best to call them generally, man by man, according to the scrip.</p>
			<p class="character">Quince</p>
			<p class="prose">Here is the scroll of every man’s name which is thought fit, through all Athens, to play in our interlude before the Duke and the Duchess on his wedding-day at night.</p>
			<p class="character">Bottom</p>
			<p class="prose">First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats on; then read the names of the actors; and so grow to a point.</p>
			<p class="character">Quince</p>
			<p class="prose">Marry, our play is ‘The most Lamentable Comedy and most Cruel Death of Pyramus and Thisby.’</p>
			<p class="character">Bottom</p>
			<p class="prose">A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.</p>
			<p class="character">Quince</p>
			<p class="verseline">Answer, as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver.</p>
			<p class="character">Bottom</p>
			<p class="verseline">Ready. Name what part I am for, and proceed.</p>
			<p class="character">Quince</p>
			<p class="verseline">You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.</p>
			<p class="character">Bottom</p>
			<p class="verseline">What is Pyramus? A lover, or a tyrant?</p>
			<p class="character">Quince</p>
			<p class="verseline">A lover, that kills himself most gallant for love.</p>
			<p class="character">Bottom</p>
			<p class="prose">That will ask some tears in the true performing of it. If I do it, let the audience look to their eyes; I will move storms; I will condole in some measure. To the rest- yet my chief humour is for a tyrant. I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to tear a cat in, to make all split.</p>
			<p class="song">‘The raging rocks</p>
			<p class="song">And shivering shocks</p>
			<p class="song">Shall break the locks</p>
			<p class="song">Of prison gates;</p>
			<p class="song">And Phibbus’ car</p>
			<p class="song">Shall shine from far,</p>
			<p class="song">And make and mar</p>
			<p class="song">The foolish Fates.’</p>
			<p class="verseline">This was lofty. Now name the rest of the players. This is</p>
			<p class="verseline">Ercles’ vein, a tyrant’s vein: a lover is more condoling.</p>
			<p class="character">Quince</p>
			<p class="verseline">Francis Flute, the bellows-mender.</p>
			<p class="character">Flute</p>
			<p class="verseline">Here, Peter Quince.</p>
			<p class="character">Quince</p>
			<p class="verseline">Flute, you must take Thisby on you.</p>
			<p class="character">Flute</p>
			<p class="verseline">What is Thisby? A wand’ring knight?</p>
			<p class="character">Quince</p>
			<p class="verseline">It is the lady that Pyramus must love.</p>
			<p class="character">Flute</p>
			<p class="prose">Nay, faith, let not me play a woman; I have a beard coming.</p>
			<p class="character">Quince</p>
			<p class="prose">That’s all one; you shall play it in a mask, and you may speak as small as you will.</p>
			<p class="character">Bottom</p>
			<p class="verseline">An I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too.</p>
			<p class="verseline">I’ll speak in a monstrous little voice: ‘Thisne, Thisne!’</p>
			<p class="verseline"><span class="stage_directions_inline">[Then speaking small]</span> ‘Ah Pyramus, my lover dear! Thy</p>
			<p class="verseline">Thisby dear, and lady dear!’</p>
			<p class="character">Quince</p>
			<p class="verseline">No, no, you must play Pyramus; and, Flute, you Thisby.</p>
			<p class="character">Bottom</p>
			<p class="verseline">Well, proceed.</p>
			<p class="character">Quince</p>
			<p class="verseline">Robin Starveling, the tailor.</p>
			<p class="character">Starveling</p>
			<p class="verseline">Here, Peter Quince.</p>
			<p class="character">Quince</p>
			<p class="verseline">Robin Starveling, you must play Thisby’s mother.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Tom Snout, the tinker.</p>
			<p class="character">Snout</p>
			<p class="verseline">Here, Peter Quince.</p>
			<p class="character">Quince</p>
			<p class="prose">You, Pyramus’ father; myself, Thisby’s father; Snug, the joiner, you, the lion’s part. And, I hope, here is a play fitted.</p>
			<p class="character">Snug</p>
			<p class="prose">Have you the lion’s part written? Pray you, if it be, give it me, for I am slow of study.</p>
			<p class="character">Quince</p>
			<p class="verseline">You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.</p>
			<p class="character">Bottom</p>
			<p class="prose">Let me play the lion too. I will roar that I will do any man’s heart good to hear me; I will roar that I will make the Duke say ‘Let him roar again, let him roar again.’</p>
			<p class="character">Quince</p>
			<p class="prose">An you should do it too terribly, you would fright the Duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek; and that were enough to hang us all.</p>
			<p class="character">All</p>
			<p class="verseline">That would hang us, every mother’s son.</p>
			<p class="character">Bottom</p>
			<p class="prose">I grant you, friends, if you should fright the ladies out of their wits, they would have no more discretion but to hang us; but I will aggravate my voice so, that I will roar you as gently as any sucking dove; I will roar you an ‘twere any nightingale.</p>
			<p class="character">Quince</p>
			<p class="prose">You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a sweet-fac’d man; a proper man, as one shall see in a summer’s day; a most lovely gentleman-like man; therefore you must needs play Pyramus.</p>
			<p class="character">Bottom</p>
			<p class="prose">Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I best to play it in?</p>
			<p class="character">Quince</p>
			<p class="verseline">Why, what you will.</p>
			<p class="character">Bottom</p>
			<p class="prose">I will discharge it in either your straw-colour beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain beard, or your French-crown-colour beard, your perfect yellow.</p>
			<p class="character">Quince</p>
			<p class="prose">Some of your French crowns have no hair at all, and then you will play bare-fac’d. But, masters, here are your parts; and I am to entreat you, request you, and desire you, to con them by to-morrow night; and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the town, by moonlight; there will we rehearse; for if we meet in the city, we shall be dogg’d with company, and our devices known.</p>
			<p class="prose">In the meantime I will draw a bill of properties, such as our play wants. I pray you, fail me not.</p>
			<p class="character">Bottom</p>
			<p class="prose">We will meet; and there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously. Take pains; be perfect; adieu.</p>
			<p class="character">Quince</p>
			<p class="verseline">At the Duke’s oak we meet.</p>
			<p class="character">Bottom</p>
			<p class="prose">Enough; hold, or cut bow-strings. </p>

			<p class="verseline">The King doth keep his revels here to-night;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Take heed the Queen come not within his sight;</p>
			<p class="verseline">For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,</p>

			<p class="verseline">She never had so sweet a changeling;</p>

			<p class="verseline">But she perforce withholds the loved boy,</p>

			<p class="verseline">And now they never meet in grove or green,</p>

			<p class="verseline">Thou speakest aright:</p>
			<p class="verseline">I am that merry wanderer of the night.</p>
			<p class="verseline">I jest to Oberon, and make him smile</p>
			<p class="verseline">When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Neighing in likeness of a filly foal;</p>
			<p class="verseline">And sometime lurk I in a gossip’s bowl</p>
			<p class="verseline">In very likeness of a roasted crab,</p>

			<p class="verseline">And in the shape of Corin sat all day,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Playing on pipes of corn, and versing love</p>
			<p class="verseline">To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Come from the farthest steep of India,</p>
			<p class="verseline">But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Your buskin’d mistress and your warrior love,</p>

			<p class="verseline">Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?</p>
			<p class="verseline">Didst not thou lead him through the glimmering night</p>
			<p class="verseline">From Perigouna, whom he ravished?</p>
			<p class="verseline">And make him with fair Aegles break his faith,</p>
			<p class="verseline">With Ariadne and Antiopa?</p>
			<p class="character">Titania</p>
			<p class="verseline">These are the forgeries of jealousy;</p>
			<p class="verseline">And never, since the middle summer’s spring,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Met we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead,</p>
			<p class="verseline">By paved fountain, or by rushy brook,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Or in the beached margent of the sea,</p>
			<p class="verseline">To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,</p>
			<p class="verseline">But with thy brawls thou hast disturb’d our sport.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,</p>
			<p class="verseline">As in revenge, have suck’d up from the sea</p>
			<p class="verseline">Contagious fogs; which, falling in the land,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Hath every pelting river made so proud</p>
			<p class="verseline">That they have overborne their continents.</p>
			<p class="verseline">The ox hath therefore stretch’d his yoke in vain,</p>
			<p class="verseline">The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn</p>
			<p class="verseline">Hath rotted ere his youth attain’d a beard;</p>
			<p class="verseline">The fold stands empty in the drowned field,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;</p>
			<p class="verseline">The nine men’s morris is fill’d up with mud,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And the quaint mazes in the wanton green,</p>
			<p class="verseline">For lack of tread, are undistinguishable.</p>
			<p class="verseline">The human mortals want their winter here;</p>
			<p class="verseline">No night is now with hymn or carol blest;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Pale in her anger, washes all the air,</p>
			<p class="verseline">That rheumatic diseases do abound.</p>
			<p class="verseline">And thorough this distemperature we see</p>
			<p class="verseline">The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts</p>
			<p class="verseline">Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose;</p>
			<p class="verseline">And on old Hiems’ thin and icy crown</p>
			<p class="verseline">An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds</p>
			<p class="verseline">Is, as in mockery, set. The spring, the summer,</p>
			<p class="verseline">The childing autumn, angry winter, change</p>
			<p class="verseline">Their wonted liveries; and the mazed world,</p>
			<p class="verseline">By their increase, now knows not which is which.</p>
			<p class="verseline">And this same progeny of evils comes</p>
			<p class="verseline">From our debate, from our dissension;</p>
			<p class="verseline">We are their parents and original.</p>

			<p class="verseline">The fairy land buys not the child of me.</p>

			<p class="verseline">And, in the spiced Indian air, by night,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Full often hath she gossip’d by my side;</p>
			<p class="verseline">And sat with me on Neptune’s yellow sands,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Marking th’ embarked traders on the flood;</p>
			<p class="verseline">When we have laugh’d to see the sails conceive,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait</p>
			<p class="verseline">Following- her womb then rich with my young squire—</p>
			<p class="verseline">Would imitate, and sail upon the land,</p>
			<p class="verseline">To fetch me trifles, and return again,</p>
			<p class="verseline">As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.</p>
			<p class="verseline">But she, being mortal, of that boy did die;</p>
			<p class="verseline">And for her sake do I rear up her boy;</p>
			<p class="verseline">And for her sake I will not part with him.</p>

			<p class="verseline">That very time I saw, but thou couldst not,</p>

			<p class="verseline">Cupid, all arm’d; a certain aim he took</p>

			<p class="verseline">As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;</p>

			<p class="verseline">Pyramus but Bottom the weaver. This will put them out of fear.</p>

			<p class="prose">Well, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be written in eight and six.</p>

My life for yours! If you think I come hither as a lion, it were pity of my life. No, I am no such thing; I am a man as other men are.’ And there, indeed, let him name his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.</p>
			<p class="character">Quince</p>

			<p class="character">Quince</p>
			<p class="prose">Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a lantern, and say he comes to disfigure or to present the person of Moonshine. Then there is another thing: we must have a wall in the great chamber; for Pyramus and Thisby, says the story, did talk through the chink of a wall.</p>
			<p class="character">Snout</p>
			<p class="verseline">You can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?</p>
			<p class="character">Bottom</p>
			<p class="prose">Some man or other must present Wall; and let him have some plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast about him, to signify wall; and let him hold his fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus and Thisby whisper.</p>
			<p class="character">Quince</p>
			<p class="prose">If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down, every mother’s son, and rehearse your parts. Pyramus, you begin; when you have spoken your speech, enter into that brake; and so every one according to his cue.</p>
